## Test from Le bon Coin
#### Goal
Given a list of files, each files symbolizing a map with spaces and obstacles, 
return for each map the largest square possible (the upper left largest square with several are possible)  
exemple:  
9.ox  
...........................  
....o......................  
............o..............  
...........................  
....o......................  
...............o...........  
...........................  
......o..............o.....  
..o.......o................  

The output should be:  
.....xxxxxxx...............  
....oxxxxxxx...............  
.....xxxxxxxo..............  
.....xxxxxxx...............  
....oxxxxxxx...............  
.....xxxxxxx...o...........  
.....xxxxxxx...............  
......o..............o.....  
..o.......o................  

The first line "9.ox" means:  
9 lines
. the space character  
o the obstacle character  
x the character to mark the largest square

If the file is not correctly formatted, it returns "map error"

#### required libraries
The only library used is pytest, it can be installed with:  
pip install -U pytest

#### Algorithm explained
The algorithm can be divided in three phases:  
The first phase consists of attributing to each slot (a slot is the area of the map 
representing by a character) a value corresponding to the space beneath it.  
The second phase consists of searching horizontally to the right the largest square possible
for each slot, assuming the slot is the upper left corner of the square.  
The last pahse is just searching the largest square among all the slots and printing it.

#### Unit testing
The testing is done by the "TestMapAnalyser" class and can be done by executing:  
pytest -s

#### Utilization
The script can be used with:  
python3 LBC_test.py [filename_1, filename_2, ....]
